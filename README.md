About:

A well-constructed Udemy course, this is an excellent course on Tableau essential. These are my notes on the section to every lesson. You might want to check my Tableau Public profile on what was constructed from the courses.

Having never used Tableau before this course, this courses helped build the foundation in Tableau. Moreover, when I took this course back in January, I was offered a Junior Data Analyst position. Since Tableau was a software they routinely used, this course was excellent.

These notes should be used as a reference. I suggest you take the course if you want to better understand Tableau. Moreover, if you do have an understanding in Tableau, I suggest you take Tableau 10 Advanced Training.
